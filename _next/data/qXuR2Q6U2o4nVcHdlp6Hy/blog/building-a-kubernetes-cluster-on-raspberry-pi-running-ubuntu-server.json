I chose Ubuntu server because it comes with 64bit and 32bit versions and I needed both type of nodes for my home cluster.\n\n## Why should anyone bother?\n\nWith low-energy consumption, Raspberry Pi is a perfect candidate for a machine that will run 24/7. When learning or developing for Kubernetes sometimes a persistent environment is a time saver. K3s, on the other hand, is a smaller, easier to set up flavor of Kubernetes that is fully compatible, but stripped down from unneeded features that are behind feature gates and by default disabled on most of the installations.\n\n## Who is it for?\n\nThis tutorial does not require any practical experience with Kubernetes or its installation process. It is written in a way that someone who is starting their adventure with Kubernetes should be able to deploy it and start learning.\n\n## What do we need\n\nTo do everything shown in this tutorial you will need:\n\n- 1 or 2 Raspberry Pi (version 3 or 4)\n- 1 or 2 micro SD cards - the faster the better\n- Power supplies for the Raspberry Pi\n- Software for writing disk images - more information can be found [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview)\n- Ubuntu Raspberry Pi images found here [https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)\n- K3sup - a great tool for simplifying installation of K3s [https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup)\n- 30 minutes of your precious time\n- Coffee or other drink\n\n## Plan\n\nWhat we will do - with optional steps:\n\n- Prepare SD cards and SSH keys\n- Setup Ubuntu server 18.04 for K3s installation\n- Disable unnecessary services (optional)\n- Bootstrap K3s cluster\n- Join second node (optional)\n- Test K3s cluster\n- Dance the \"victory dance\" (optional)\n\n## Preparing for the installation\n\nBefore we begin the installation we need two things. First, we need to prepare SD cards with Ubuntu server 18.04. The images can be downloaded from here [https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi). Instructions on how to prepare a bootable SD card from those images can be found here [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview).\n\nNext, we need to create SSH keys for k3sup, so we'll be able to install K3s on a Raspberry Pi node. If you have your own SSH keys, you can skip this step. To create SSH keys run the following:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/rpi -P \"\"\n```\n\nand add it to ssh key agent\n\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/rpi\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAfter booting up your Raspberry Pi with the fresh Ubuntu installation, you have to check its IP address. You can do that by logging to your router and checking the DHCP settings for a new lease for a hostname \"ubuntu\". You can also do it the old fashion way - connect keyboard and monitor to your Raspberry Pi and log into the machine. Both the username and login is **ubuntu -** after logging in you will have to immediately change your password and log once again**.** Once you're there run\n\n```bash\nip addr show eth0\n```\n\nAnd you should see something like this:\n\n```bash\n2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether dc:a6:32:76:1b:91 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.0.238/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic eth0\n       valid_lft 329sec preferred_lft 329sec\n    inet6 fe80::dea6:32ff:fe76:1b91/64 scope link\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forev\n```\n\nOK, from now we can remotely log in to the machine and the keyboard and monitor won't be necessary.\n\nLet's log into the machine by running\n\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.0.238\n```\n\nIf you did not log in before you will have to change your password.\n\nLet's log out and copy the SSH keys, so we won't have to use the password for every login - also for **k3sup** to be able to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. To copy the SSH keys to the machine run the following\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id -i .ssh/rpi ubuntu@192.168.0.238\n```\n\nYou should be prompted for password and after successful login you should see something like this\n\n```bash\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \".ssh/rpi.pub\"\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nubuntu@192.168.0.238's password:\n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'ubuntu@192.168.0.238'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\nNow we can SSH into the Raspberry Pi and finish the system installation.\n\nLet's check how much resources are used by the system\n\n```bash\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           3791         183        2369           6        1238        3552\nSwap:             0           0           0\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ vmstat 1\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 0  0      0 2426232  77056 1191676    0    0    81   261  182  192 10  5 84  2  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77056 1191704    0    0     0     0   53   48  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77056 1191704    0    0     0     0   46   44  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77056 1191704    0    0     0     0   57   59  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191696    0    0     0    28   62   70  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426264  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   53   57  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   64   75  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   49   47  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   48   47  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0    20   48   49  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   71   73  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 2426232  77064 1191712    0    0     0     0   48   48  0  0 100  0  0\n```\n\nAs we can see, the base resource utilization is very low and the Raspberry Pi has quite a bit to offer :)\n\nLet's do a quick system update and then make one necessary change so that Kubernetes will work on this machine.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\n```\n\nNow let's edit the boot options **/boot/firmware/nobtcmd.txt** and add **cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory** to the end of the line so that file will look like this\n\n```bash\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cat /boot/firmware/nobtcmd.txt\nnet.ifnames=0 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=LABEL=writable rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fixrtc cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory\n```\n\nIf you skip this part. K3s will fail after bootstrapping the cluster and you will be able to find something along those lines in the logs:\n\n```bash\nApr  4 20:22:27 rpi-master k3s[2204]: time=\"2020-04-04T20:22:27.635180523Z\" level=error msg=\"Failed to find memory cgroup, you may need to add \\\"cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory\\\" to your linux cmdline (/boot/cmdline.txt on a Raspberry Pi)\"\n```\n\nhowever on ubuntu it's actually the **nobtmcd.txt** file.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the Raspberry Pi has a static IP. This is important for both the master and all the additional nodes. If you have access and know how, you can just set the IP on your router to be static, so that after every reboot the machine will always get the same IP. Alternatively, we can set up our Ubuntu to have a static IP. To do this, we need to edit the file **/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml** to look like this:\n\n```bash\nnetwork:\n  version: 2\n  renderer: networkd\n  ethernets:\n    eth0:\n     dhcp4: no\n     addresses: [192.168.0.120/24]\n     gateway4: 192.168.0.1\n     nameservers:\n       addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]\n```\n\nMore information about this topic can be found here [https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux)\n\nLast thing to do - set up a unique and friendly hostname, as \"ubuntu\" will be too generic - especially when we will have more than 1 node. To do so, edit the **/etc/hostname** and set the name to your liking. I chose **rpi-master** for my master node.\n\nThis is it for the installation, you can repeat this process on a second node. I've set up my second Raspberry Pi with the IP **192.168.0.121** and hostname **rpi-worker-1**\n\n## Optimizations (optional)\n\nAs I dislike having anything unnecessary running in my system - and also I will run many tests and benchmarks on my cluster - I prefer not to have time-based actions or system updates done automatically. Because of that, I prefer to remove almost every service from the system.\n\nTo disable all the services that are not needed for running k3s run the following\n\n```bash\n# no WIFI for the server\nsudo systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service\n# no time based tasks executed\nsudo systemctl disable atd.service\nsudo systemctl disable cron\n# no restart of services and auto updates - I prefer to run updates myself\nsudo systemctl disable unattended-upgrades.service\n```\n\nreboot and....\n\n```bash\nubuntu@rpi-master:~$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           3791         169        3423           6         198        3566\nSwap:             0           0           0\n```\n\nOK, so we gained 14 MB, and we can be sure that nothing will suddenly run in the background while running tests. As I love to min/max things, I'm happy with the result!\n\n## Bootstrapping the cluster\n\nTo bootstrap the K3s cluster run the following command\n\n```bash\nk3sup install --user ubuntu --sudo --ip 192.168.0.120 --ssh-key ~/.ssh/rpi\n```\n\nand validate by running\n\n```bash\nexport KUBECONFIG=/home/upgrade/kubeconfig\n```\n\nWait 1-5 minutes, depending on your network bandwidth and you should be able to run the same commands and have similar output\n\n```bash\nupgrade@ZeroOne ~ $ kubectl get pod -A\nNAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE\nkube-system   local-path-provisioner-58fb86bdfd-hmcbr   1/1     Running     0          104s\nkube-system   metrics-server-6d684c7b5-dl27c            1/1     Running     0          104s\nkube-system   coredns-d798c9dd-zhht7                    1/1     Running     0          104s\nkube-system   helm-install-traefik-s2hzn                0/1     Completed   2          104s\nkube-system   svclb-traefik-4cwg9                       2/2     Running     0          29s\nkube-system   traefik-6787cddb4b-kcj9j                  1/1     Running     0          30s\nupgrade@ZeroOne ~ $ kubectl  cluster-info\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.0.120:6443\nCoreDNS is running at https://192.168.0.120:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy\nMetrics-server is running at https://192.168.0.120:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:/proxy\n\nTo further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.\n```\n\nAnd the cluster is up and running!\n\nIf this is your only cluster, copy the config file to **~/.kube/config** for convenience. You won't have to export the environment variable **KUBECONFIG** to access this cluster.\n\nAs we can see the load on our master node jumped up a bit\n\n```bash\nubuntu@rpi-master:~$ vmstat 1\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 0  0      0 2218940  29752 873468    0    0    82   614  978 1593 10  9 76  6  0\n 0  0      0 2218688  29752 873496    0    0     0     0 2855 5331  2  3 95  0  0\n 0  0      0 2218688  29760 873496    0    0     0    32 2463 4605  1  2 97  0  0\n 2  0      0 2217132  29760 873496    0    0     0     0 5417 9919  5 12 83  0  0\n 0  0      0 2217964  29760 873496    0    0     0     0 3459 5780  1 20 78  0  0\n 0  0      0 2217664  29760 873496    0    0     0     0 3194 5897  3  4 94  0  0\n 0  0      0 2218924  29760 873496    0    0     0     0 4327 7566  4 13 83  0  0\n 0  0      0 2218672  29768 873496    0    0     0    24 3040 5547  2  3 95  0  0\n 1  0      0 2218672  29768 873496    0    0     0     4 2758 5124  2  3 95  0  0\n 4  0      0 2218672  29768 873496    0    0     0     0 3057 5681  2  3 95  0  0\n 0  0      0 2218704  29768 873496    0    0     0     0 3480 6466  3  3 94  0  0\n 0  0      0 2218704  29768 873496    0    0     0     0 3130 5789  2  2 95  0  0\n```\n\nBut there is still plenty of resources for our apps to use.\n\nWe can also verify if Traefik and the service load balancer (which emulates cloud load balancers) are working, by trying to connect to the IP of the cluster master through the browser or by running the following\n\n```bash\nupgrade@ZeroOne ~ $ curl http://192.168.0.120\n404 page not found\n```\n\nWe got a response, so that means the ingress is also working correctly. We just don't have anything deployed yet, so Traefik does not serve anything.\n\n## Join the node\n\n```bash\nk3sup join --user ubuntu --sudo  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/upgnet/rpi  --server-ip 192.168.0.120  --ip 192.168.0.121\n```\n\nwait a couple of seconds and … TADAM!\n\n```bash\nupgrade@ZeroOne ~ $ kubectl get node\nNAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION\nrpi-master     Ready    master   21m   v1.17.2+k3s1\nrpi-worker-1   Ready    <none>   17s   v1.17.2+k3s1\nupgrade@ZeroOne ~ $ kubectl top node\nNAME           CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%\nrpi-master     367m         9%     712Mi           18%\nrpi-worker-1   51m          1%     221Mi           5%\n```\n\nIf you SSH into the node and run\n\n```bash\nubuntu@rpi-worker-1:~$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           3822         227        3222          10         372        3546\nSwap:             0           0           0\nubuntu@rpi-worker-1:~$ vmstat 1\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 2  0      0 3299888  19420 361952    0    0   193   256  289  390  4  5 90  2  0\n 0  0      0 3299660  19420 361980    0    0     0     0  614 1029  1  1 98  0  0\n 1  0      0 3299660  19420 361980    0    0     0    16  578  994  1  0 99  0  0\n 1  0      0 3299628  19420 361980    0    0     0     0  544  951  0  1 99  0  0\n 1  0      0 3299628  19420 361980    0    0     0     0  346  582  0  0 100  0  0\n 0  0      0 3299504  19428 361980    0    0     0    12  597 1013  1  1 99  0  0\n 0  0      0 3299472  19428 361996    0    0     0     0  530  893  1  0 99  0  0\n 0  0      0 3299472  19428 361996    0    0     0     0  986 1721  1  1 98  0  0\n 1  0      0 3299220  19428 361996    0    0     0     0 1138 1940  1  2 97  0  0\n 1  0      0 3299220  19428 361996    0    0     0     0  718 1249  0  1 99  0  0\n 1  0      0 3298968  19428 361996    0    0     0     0  507  844  0  1 99  0  0\n```\n\nyou will see that the performance hit is mostly on the master. The worker node still has almost all resources available - which is also reflected by the output of the **kubectl top node** command.\n\n## It wasn't that bad, was it?\n\nCool! So now we have our Kubernetes cluster with Traefik as Ingress controller, metrics service and a local storage provisioner. And the whole preparation took way longer than the cluster setup itself. Now it's time to explore Kubernetes with all its glory!\n\n## And for all you UI lovers\n\nIf you like UI, especially the console ones, I strongly recommend using K9s that you can find here [https://github.com/derailed/k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)\n\nHere is the state of the cluster shown in K9s\n\n![list-of-pods-in-the-K9s-UI](/blog-images/list-of-pods-in-the-K9s-UI.png)\n\n![list-of-nodes-in-the-K9s-UI](/blog-images/list-of-nodes-in-the-K9s-UI.png)\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\nSo now you have a complete running Kubernetes cluster, with one or two nodes. Traefik ingress controller is set up so you can deploy any application and use its built-in option to obtain SSL certificates to run it securely even in your home. The metrics service is there, so initial monitoring of your applications is enabled and you can learn a lot about their behaviour in the cluster. You can also start learning Kubernetes and training for the CKAD and CKA certification if you fancy, as you can practice almost everything apart from setting up cluster on this cluster ;) As for me, I'm planning to deploy IceCI to the cluster and start building more applications for the ARM architecture.\n\nReadout:\n\nTraefik: [https://docs.traefik.io/](https://docs.traefik.io/)\n\nK3s: [https://k3s.io/](https://k3s.io/)\n\nK3sup: [https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup)\n\nK9s: [https://github.com/derailed/k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)\n\nKubernetes documentation: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
